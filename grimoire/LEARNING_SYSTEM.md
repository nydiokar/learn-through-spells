## Safety System
- Prerequisites for advanced spells
- Warning systems for dangerous combinations
- Best practices as magical principles
- Debug/troubleshooting as spell diagnosis

## Implementation Guidelines
For Each Spell:
- Pattern (What it does)
- Components (How it works)
- Practice (How to use it)
- Mastery (How to verify learning)

## Structure Example:
```javascript
// ECHO spell (console.log)
// Pattern: Reveals the hidden essence of any value
// Components: console object, log method, value to reveal
// Practice: Echo different types of values
// Mastery: When you can inspect any value's true form
console.log("Hello, World");
```
